His early and already remarkable performances were followed by a solid training at the Barcelona Conservatory. He performed his first tenor role in an opera in 1970: Flavio, in Bellini's Norma. His musical intelligence, his ability to embody the most diverse roles as well as his sumptuous voice make him a breathtaking tenor, a total artist.</p>
